To open the project in eclipse
Option 1) Use the WAR file (http://help.eclipse.org/indigo/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.wst.webtools.doc.user%2Ftopics%2Ftwimpwar.html)
	To import the Web project resources in a WAR file into your workspace, complete the following steps:
	Select File > Import .
	In the Import dialog, select WAR file and then click Next.
	Locate the WAR file that you want to import using the Browse button.
	The wizard assumes you want to create a new Web project with the same name as the WAR file.
	If you accept this choice, the project will be created with the same servlet version as specified by the WAR file and in the same location.
	If you want to override these settings, you can click New and specify your new settings in the Dynamic Web Project wizard.
	Click Finish to populate the Web project.

Option 2) Use the source files. This option requires the third party JAR and API librarys are installed (including Drools, Spring)
	Open eclipse.
	File->Import->Existing Project Into Workspace
	Select root directory of source files.
	Finish.
